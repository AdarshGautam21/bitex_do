                      MUMBAI: Indian crypto entrepreneurs are urging investors
                      not to panic-sell assets like bitcoin and ether after
                      prices crashed over 30% this week. According to
                      cryptocurrency exchanges, investors should decide if they
                      can sustain with locked funds for 3-4 years, and use only
                      risk capital for what would be more of an allocation for
                      long-term appreciation.

                      India has noted an uptick in crypto users over the past

                      attributed to the Supre Courtâ€™s decision to quash the
                      Central Bankâ€™s circular that called for a banking ban for
                      crypto transactions in 2018. This judgment has temporarily
